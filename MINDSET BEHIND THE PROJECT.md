# Random-Color-Generator
This project is about randomizing colors, wich i am using two types of randomizer. One is the simple, wich means that i pre set color values and just randomized between them.
The another version is the true randomizer, where i set the hexadecimal sequence between "0" and "F" wich gave me 16 characters to randomize between them and get a number corresponding to a color.
